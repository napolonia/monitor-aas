## To install: just copy all files to their directories

## Then restart serf: /etc/init.d/serf restart
## Make sure serf is actually restarted, because it needs to load the handler
## otherwise it will not clean the extraInfo tag
#########
## Important to know: the modifications made were the introduction
## of calling resources/monitor-as/common.sh gather_information <service> <info_needed>
## when services are published, either in php or .service files
#########
## There should not be any problems in Cloudy itself
## For future work, the monitor system will appear as a webpage
## the current extra.php under check-serf should NOT be used as is :)
