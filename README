## To install: just copy all files to their directories
#########
## Then restart serf: /etc/init.d/serf restart
## Make sure serf is actually restarted, because it needs to load the handler
## otherwise it will not clean the extraInfo tag

## Important to know: the modifications made were the introduction
## of calling resources/monitor-as/common.sh gather_information <service> <info_needed>
## when services are published, either in php or .service files
#########
## There should not be any problems in Cloudy itself
## For future work, the monitor system will appear as a webpage
## I've added on System menu - monitor-as which will present the webpage, still needs working
#########
## The introduction of docker in cloudy can be seen in the docker page
## We install a container of a given service (building a docker image), just peerstreamer at the moment
## Then we can launch the service (in container) as before without the user noticing it is a container
## The containers can then be stopped when the service is no longer needed/wanted
## Everytime a service is launched, its publication to Avahi/SERF is done the same way however:
## For the monitor-as we gather more information from inside the container and outside container
